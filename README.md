 ## Description
This React-Portfolio-Node was created for bootcamp students who were taking the thirteenth week's challenge. In this challenge, my task was to use React to create initial scaffolding of your portfolio sites.

The React Portfolio must meet the following critical requirements:
* [ ] App:
  * [ ] Must be your top level component and render all necessary children components
* [ ] Header:
  * [ ] Must be rendered across the entire site
  * [ ] Must Contain a Navbar
* [ ] Project Gallery:
  * [ ] Must render dynamically 6 instances of the Project component
    * [ ] Be sure to store your project data in a JSON file and import it into your project
* [ ] Project:
  * [ ] Must be a reusable component that ingests JSON data as a props and renders a single instance for each project.
  * [ ] Must utilize router props to properly render the right project based on user selection
  * [ ] Must render the following info:
    * [ ] Project title
    * [ ] Link to the deployed version
    * [ ] Link to the GitHub repository
    * [ ] GIF or screenshot of the deployed application
* [ ] Contact:
  * [ ] Must have contact information
  * [ ] Have a contact form for handling events
* [ ] Home:
  * This should be a welcome landing page that contains:
    * [ ] Your Name
    * [ ] A Headshot of you
    * [ ] Your brand statement
    * [ ] Some indication that this is your portfolio site
